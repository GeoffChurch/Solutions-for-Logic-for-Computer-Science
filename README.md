# Solutions for _Logic for Computer Science: Foundations of Automatic Theorem Proving (2nd ed)_

These Markdown files include LaTeX-style math expressions. [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) and VS Code's [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) extension work for me.

There are a lot of exercises, so if you have your own proofs/programs/proofs-as-programs/corrections, feel free to submit a pull request.

Note: Gallier writes $(f \circ g)(x)$ to mean $g(f(x))$.
