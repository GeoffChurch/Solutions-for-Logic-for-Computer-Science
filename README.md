# Solutions for _Logic for Computer Science: Foundations of Automatic Theorem Proving (2nd ed)_

There are a lot of exercises, so if you have your own proofs/`programs`/proofs-as-`programs`/corrections, feel free to submit a pull request.

### Workflow

I'm using VS Code's [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) extension to read/edit the Markdown files, and the `Save Markdown+Math to HTML` command to generate the html files (GitHub's built-in Markdown renderer doesn't render math).
